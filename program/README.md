# Suitcase-RPi
suitcase controll for the RPi
this software controlls the NMEA sensors in the siutcase, parses the data and sends it over ethernet.

The system can add more sensors, but the limiting factor is the amount of ports on the RPi
the system also meshures the distance and sends a boolean value to confirm that it has traveld a set distance.
